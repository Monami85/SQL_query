Rockbuster Stealth LLC - SQL Data Analysis Project
Overview
Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a global movie rental company transitioning from physical stores to an online video rental service to stay competitive against streaming giants like Netflix and Amazon Prime. The company plans to leverage its existing movie licenses and launch a new platform. As part of the Business Intelligence (BI) department, I have been tasked with analyzing Rockbusterâ€™s data to help shape its launch strategy.

Objectives
The Rockbuster management team has outlined several key questions to guide the analysis :
a.	Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain? <br />
b.	What was the average rental duration for all videos? <br />
c.	Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in? <br />
d.	Where are customers with a high lifetime value located? <br />
e.	Do sales figures vary across geographic regions? <br />
The results of this analysis will assist Rockbuster in identifying opportunities to improve customer experience, optimize revenue and target high-value customers effectively.
